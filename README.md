# Project 64 - Ocarina of Time Randomizer - Music and Fanfare Finder V1.0

This script is designed to be used with the emulator Project 64 when playing the game "Ocarina of Time Randomizer". It will find the music and the fanfare played in the game and write them to two separate text files - "Music Zelda Rando.txt" and "Fanfare Zelda Rando.txt" which can be used in your favorite live-streaming software.

## Usage

1. Copy the files to your "Project-64/Scripts" Directory.
2. Start Project 64 and load a Ocarina of Time Randomizer rom.
3. Run the script in the emulator.
4. The script will automatically detect the music and fanfare played in the game and write them to the designated text files.

## Requirements

- Project 64 emulator
- A Ocarina of Time Randomized game ROM
- The cosmetic spoiler in the same directory as the ROM

## Notes

- The two text files will be created in the same directory as the script.
- The script will only find music and fanfare played after it is run. It will not record music and fanfare from previous gameplay sessions.
